## Introduction

Portfolio managers and quantitative analysts spend a great deal of effort trying to understand how financial assets move together. If two stocks go up and down in near lockstep, holding both does little for diversification. Conversely, assets that move in opposite directions can hedge one another. The standard tool for quantifying these co-movements is the **Pearson correlation coefficient**, which yields values in $[-1, 1]$: a value near $+1$ means the two assets are highly correlated, near $-1$ means they are anticorrelated, and near $0$ means they are essentially uncorrelated.

A natural next step is to **cluster** assets into groups such that **intra-cluster correlations are high** (the assets in each group move together) and **inter-cluster correlations are low or negative** (different groups capture different market factors). This is the asset clustering problem, and it lies at the heart of:
