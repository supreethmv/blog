# About Me

üëã Hi! I'm Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh, a quantum AI researcher passionate about the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize data-heavy fields like earth observation, game theory, and finance.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at Technical University of Kaiserslautern, where I'm delving deep into developing and benchmarking quantum algorithms against classical state-of-the-art methods for solving computationally expensive problems. My Master's degree from Saarland University provided a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science. I've had the opportunity to work on various research projects and collaborate with prestigious institutions like the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).

### üî¨What I‚Äôm Passionate About
I'm dedicated to developing systematic approaches for quantum software that can keep pace with the rapid evolution of quantum computing. My research focuses on creating innovative quantum algorithms and assessing the potential of current and near-future quantum computers to handle complex AI tasks.

### üí° Why This Blog?
This blog serves as a bridge between my research and the broader community. Here, I dive into concepts like quantum neural networks and quantum algorithms for complex problems, breaking them down to make these complex ideas accessible and engaging for readers of all backgrounds.

Feel free to reach out if our interests align or if you have a curiosity in the world of Quantum AI.
