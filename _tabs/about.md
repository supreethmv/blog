# About Me

üëã Hello! I‚Äôm Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh, a Quantum AI researcher driven by the possibilities of quantum computing and its applications in data-intensive fields like earth observation, game theory, and finance.

With a PhD underway in Computer Science at RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, my journey has been nothing short of a deep dive into the world of algorithms and complex problem-solving. During my Master‚Äôs at Saarland University, I cultivated a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, navigating diverse research projects and working closely with renowned institutes like the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).

### üî¨What I‚Äôm Passionate About
Building systematic approaches to quantum software that align with rapid advances in quantum computing. I have developed novel quantum algorithms and exploring the feasibility of exisiting and near-term quantum computers for complex tasks in AI.

### üí° Why This Blog?
This blog serves as a bridge between my research and the broader community. Here, I dive into concepts like quantum neural networks, financial quantum algorithms, and satellite coalition theory‚Äîbreaking them down to make these complex ideas accessible and engaging for readers of all backgrounds.

Feel free to reach out if our interests align or if you have a curiosity in the world of Quantum AI.
