# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh, a Quantum AI researcher driven by the limitless possibilities of quantum computing and its applications in data-intensive fields like satellite observation, image processing, and finance.

With a PhD underway in Computer Science at RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau, my journey has been nothing short of a deep dive into the world of algorithms and complex problem-solving. During my Masterâ€™s at Saarland University, I cultivated a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, navigating diverse research projects and working closely with renowned institutes like the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).

### ðŸ”¬What Iâ€™m Passionate About
Building systematic approaches to quantum software that align with rapid advances in quantum computing. I have developed novel quantum algorithms and exploring the feasibility of exisiting and near-term quantum computers for complex tasks in AI.

### ðŸ’¡ Why This Blog?
This blog serves as a bridge between my research and the broader community. Here, I dive into concepts like quantum neural networks, financial quantum algorithms, and satellite coalition theoryâ€”breaking them down to make these complex ideas accessible and engaging for readers of all backgrounds.

When Iâ€™m not immersed in research, you can find me enjoying a good Weizen beer or exploring the realms of digital finance through quantum computing use cases. Feel free to reach out if our interests align or if you have a curiosity in the world of Quantum AI.
